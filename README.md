# Project Objective


## Development Process

### Phase 1: Prototype (Browser)
- Implement basic 3D rendering of the 4x4x4 cube using Three.js
- Add interaction: Mouse click to place markers on the cube's external faces
- Implement basic rotation using mouse dragging and keyboard controls
- Display simple win conditions (4-in-a-row) and allow reset

### Phase 2: Game Logic
- Implement logic for determining if a Gedanke has been achieved
- Add move history tracking (chess notation style)
- Introduce simple UI elements (title, history toggle, reset button)

### Phase 3: UX Enhancements
- Improve 3D shading and visual feedback (hover effects, marker placement animation)
- Fine-tune the cube rotation mechanics for smoothness
- Implement responsive design for mobile compatibility

### Phase 4: WebApp/Optional Features
- Implement WebApp (PWA) features such as offline support, push notifications for move reminders (in multiplayer)
- Optionally, explore multiplayer capabilities using WebSockets or Firebase

## Tools & Technologies

### Frontend
- HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript
- React (optional)
- Three.js or Unity WebGL for 3D rendering
- WebSockets or Firebase for multiplayer (if needed)

### Backend (optional)
- Node.js, Express
- MongoDB or Firebase

### Mobile/WebApp
- PWA or native mobile development using React Native or Flutter

## Deployment & Hosting
- Vercel or Netlify for quick and easy deployment of the WebApp
- If using Unity, deployment via WebGL or Unity Play for browser and App Store for mobile

## Notes
- This is the developer's first game development project
- Developer has limited programming skills
- Initial development and running will be done locally
- Across chat sessions after long chats, the developer will prompt for dev update summary to be used for input in a new chat to continue the development
